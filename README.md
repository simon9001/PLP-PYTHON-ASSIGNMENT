# 🧮 Basic Calculator Program  Python

This is a simple command-line calculator built using Python. It allows a user to input two numbers and choose a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts **user input** for two numbers and a mathematical operator.
- Supports **four operations**:
  - Addition `+`
  - Subtraction `-`
  - Multiplication `*`
  - Division `/`
- Handles **division by zero** safely.
- Provides **clear and readable output**.
- Designed for **beginners** learning Python input/output and basic control structures.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the **first number**.
2. Then, it asks for the **second number**.
3. Next, it requests a **mathematical operation** (i.e., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. Based on the selected operation, the program performs the calculation.
5. The result is then printed in a readable format (e.g., `10 + 5 = 15`).

## 📦 Example Output

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
